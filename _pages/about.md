👨🏻‍💻 I'm a fifth year robotics PhD student at University of Michigan in the [MMINT Lab](https://mmintlab.com), where I work under the guidance of [Prof. Nima Fazeli](https://www.mmintlab.com/people/nima-fazeli/).

🔬 My research focuses on tactile-based manipulation, combining learning, optimization, and controls to enable robots to interact more intelligently and effectively with their environments.

🎓 As I approach graduation (March 2025), I'm excited to explore opportunities to apply my skills and advance robotics research. These days, I'm particularly interested in using tactile sensing for dexterous conctact-rich robotic manipulation.
